I am also taking a specific focus on kubernetes and the automation, configuration, and management of clusters. Additionally, I also have experience with troubleshooting hardware, software, and applications with most major operating systems and other major applications.
        \nI also have experience with leadership. As an Eagle Scout and member of the Order of the Arrow, I was in charge of the planning, design, and execution for my Eagle Scout project, which involved the management of 15 plus people of all ages. A a Chapter Chief and Senior Patrol Leader I have experience organizing and leading meetings to ensure the competition of assigned weekly tasks. All of which led to a multitude of experience working with others.
